# Project Overview:

This project aims to counter online scammers who use fake bank website links to steal innocent people's data. Using Python and Selenium, the project automates webpages that enter realistic-looking names, IDs, and bank details. As a twist, the scammers' own phone numbers are included as call back numbers. The code is run multiple times to obscure genuine data among fake information, making it more difficult for scammers to differentiate.

Note: Please be aware that this project is designed to work on a specific website whose links were provided to the developer. Different scam websites will likely require different approaches. This project is intended to inspire similar initiatives rather than provide a universal solution.
